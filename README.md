# Principles of Programming Midterm project

## Project

Using the data and code you developed for your last assignment, fill out this repo repository so that it:

1. Outlines the problem you have identified and states data source data (in README2.md)
2. Describes the data (in an import notebook)
3. Contains the necessary notebooks to load, test and clean the data, build features, and prep the data for modeling (three notebooks in total, no need to include the EDA notebook).

Select two of the four functions you have created in the previous assignment, and remove them from the code. 

Add two issues to the repo requesting the creation of functions with capabilities of the functions that you deleted. The issues should describe the functions, including properties of the features that might be used for testing in an assert. Also include sample data or expected output based on the training dataframe to test the output of the function.   

## Due dates

Your repo pushed: Oct 28, 1:10pm
Issue closed and code pushed: Nov 1, 1:10pm

Please push your final changes to your repo by *Monday class (Oct 28, 1:10pm)*. 

On Friday, you'll be assigned a repo at random. Clone the repo, review the code, and choose one of the two issues to work on and close by adding a function to the feature engineering notebook. Use an assert to test that the function is operating as intended. In the space provided below, award points based on the number of questions you needed to ask the repo owner to complete your work. Please make your commit and push by *Friday class (Nov 1, 1:10pm)*. 

## Grading
